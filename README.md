## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. When the page loads, it checks `localStorage` for any saved time.
2. Pressing **Start** begins counting seconds, updating every second.
3. Pressing **Stop** pauses the timer.
4. Pressing **Reset** stops the timer and clears both the display and stored time.

## 📌 Notes

- The stopwatch continues from where it left off after a reload.
- Button interactions include hover animations.
- Background and font styling ensure a modern, soft look.
